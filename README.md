# OpenFOAM-v2412 GPU Acceleration 🚀🖥️

**Fully GPU-accelerated OpenFOAM based on OpenFOAM-v2412**


---
## Overview

This project is a **fully GPU-powered** version of OpenFOAM (v2412), designed to accelerate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using modern GPU architectures. Leveraging CUDA and advanced GPU computing techniques, this implementation aims to deliver significant speedups compared to traditional CPU-based OpenFOAM.

The project is under active development and maintenance to continuously improve performance, stability, and usability.
